This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
#Imports
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("psych")
library(psych)
```

#Question 1
```{r}
schools <- read_csv('C:/Users/Karsyn/Documents/DTSC 650/AP2021-Schools.csv')
schools
psych::describe(schools)

Q1<- schools%>%
  filter(PerctPass>0)%>%
  group_by(District)%>%
  summarise(Avg= round(mean(PerctPass),2))%>%
  arrange(desc(Avg))%>%
  head(10) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
  
```

#Question 2
#ID top 4 schools in Georgetown or Horry districts with highest examto student ratio. Exclude schools with 10 or fewer test takers
```{r}
Q2<-schools %>%
  filter(NumStudents >10 & District == 'Georgetown' | NumStudents >10 & District == 'Horry') %>%
  mutate(ratio = NumExams/NumStudents) %>%
  select(HS, ratio) %>% 
  arrange(desc(ratio)) %>%
  head(4) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

  


```

#Question 3
#Which districts have the most schools in them offering AP Exams? State the names of the top 3 districts
```{r}
Q3<-schools %>%
  group_by(District)%>%
  summarise(APschools = n())%>%
  arrange(desc(APschools))%>%
  head(3) %>% 
  select(District) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
